Welcome
=======

Welcome to the launching of a new general education course at Virginia Tech on *computational thinking*. This course grew out of the university's  asking and answering certain questions about what it takes to be prepared to live and thrive in an increasingly technological society. These questions and their answers are the starting point for the course.

Why Know About Computation?
---------------------------

Computing and its artifacts are everywhere and its influence touches everything. The easily recognized form factors of computing - desktop machines, laptops, tablets, smart phones - are commonplace. These forms of computation enable our communications, play our music, entertain us, provide directions, give us the news, stitch together the fabric of our social networks, and offer us things to buy, watch, learn, and read. In the periphery of our awareness are computers that control the operation of our cars and planes, regulate the power grid, monitor the appliances in our homes, control the robots that build things, and guide the weapons of military forces. It is difficult to imagine how many times each day we come in direct or indirect contact with computing. The envisioned "internet of things" is a forecast of continued pervasive and ubiquitous presence of computation in our daily life.

Computation has altered the fundamental ways by which humankind explores the universe through scientific discovery and reshapes its world through engineered creations. Traditional forms of inquiry rest on well established paradigms of theory, often expressed in mathematics, and experimentation. For centuries these paradigms have been the driving forces behind the growth in knowledge and progress from the Renaissance to the atomic age. Computing is now recognized as the "third pillar" - along with theory and experimentation - of science and engineering. Computational science and engineering enable discovery and innovation not possible in its absence. From the study of the human genome to the identification of planets orbiting other suns, computation is indispensable.

The rise of the "digital humanities" is a reflection of the intertwining of computation into the ways by which we understand and express humanities role in the world. Beyond providing simply better tools for doing the same work, computation has extended the modes of inquiry and expression that are possible. As biologists have used computing to move from studying one gene to studying an entire genome so scholars have moved from the "close reading" of one text to the "far reading" of all of an author's texts or all of the texts of a period or genre. Computation provides the visual and performing artists with a new "canvas" and new "orchestras" to explore new forms of creative expression. Furthermore, computation can itself be "problematized" so that humanists can take computationally constructed processes and objects as subjects of study. For example, sociologists study on-line social networks as they have similarly studied human populations in "real" environments.

The widespread infusion of computation into virtually all facets of human activity has implications for the citizens and professionals of tomorrow. How must we be able to think our world in order to be informed citizens and productive practitioners in some professional occupation.

In short, we need to know something about computation because it is everywhere.


What is Computational Thinking?
-------------------------------

The phrase “computational thinking” has come to be taken as the term of art to describe a mode of thought that a report by the National Research Council says:

    “... includes a broad range of mental tools and concepts from computer science that help people solve problems, design systems, understand human behavior, and engage computers to assist in automating a wide range of intellectual processes.”

More concretely Jeannette Wing wrote that:

    “Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent.”

These definitions are made concrete in this course through two key concepts that will, for us, define computational thinking:

* abstraction: an ability to cope with complexity so as to be able to frame problems and design effective solutions,

* algorithms: the key ideas needed to create a process that an automated agent (e.g., a computer) could carry out

These two ideas wrap together to allow us to see the world through a computational lens and understand something of how the the automated devices in that world function.


What is the Benefit?
--------------------

Armed with the capacity to think computationally we are better able to comprehend the world around us and participate actively in shaping that world. The National Research Council identifies a number of specific benefits to individuals and society that flow from a broadly shared sense of computational thinking. Among these are:

* Succeeding in a technological society because we have a better understanding of the forces affecting our society.
* Maintaining and enhancing U.S economic competitiveness because we can better deploy the power of computation in creating products and services of value.
* Supporting inquiry in many disciplines because of the infusion of computation into virtually fields of study.
* Enabling personal empowerment because we add to our toolkit of problem-solving skills those that deal with managing complexity and structuring effective processes.

Naturally, this course cannot completely provide all of these benefits fully to everyone. But this course can create a solid and necessary foundation for further work and study.

What are the Learning Objectives?
---------------------------------

This course is designed to achieve four learning objectives. They are:

1. Apply the foundational principles of computational thinking to frame questions and devise a solution in a particular area of study.
2. Analyze a model based on computational methods to investigate complex or large scale phenomenon
3. Explain the application of computational thinking across multiple knowledge domains.
4. Identify the social or political impacts of computing and information technology.

Your engagement in this will help us determine how well we are meeting these objectives.
