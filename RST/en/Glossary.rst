    Abstraction
        A simplified representation of an entity that is used in a computation. The term "entity" is chosen because abstractions can be formed about anything - people, places, actions, objects, events, processes, etc.

        An abstraction only makes sense in a *context*. For example, consider the context of painting a Rose. If you describe the Rose as "a green stem with red petals", you are ignoring:

        * The cost of the Rose at the local Kroger ($1.25),
        * How much it weighs (.5 lbs), and
        * How many people have seen it (7 people).

        These other attributes are not useful in knowing how to paint the rose. However, if you were a grocer selling roses, you do need to know how much it costs, and you don't really care if it's got red petals or white petals. The same thing might be abstracted very differently depending on the context.

    Algorithm
        A series of instructions that tell how to solve a problem. When these instructions are written for a computer, they are written in a :term:`Programming Language`.

    Big Data
        Information that cannot be analyzed with conventional means. Often, this kind of data is:

        * Too big
        * Being created too quickly
        * Too complicated and multi-facted

    Computational Model
        A representation of a phenomenon or object inside a computer that is easy to manipulate. By changing the :term:`parameters` of a Model, you can change its outcomes and answer questions.

    Java
        A popular programming language in industry. Some introductory programming courses use Java, but this course does not.

    NetLogo
        NetLogo is a programming language and a programming environment used to create a :term:`Computational Model`. It is used by tens of thousands of students, teachers and researchers worldwide.

    Parameters
        A program or a function almost always has parameters, which are also called "inputs" or "arguments". This is the way that data is given to the program or function. For instance, if you call a program to calculate the weather for a city, the city is a parameter.

    Programming Language
        A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do (instructions). All computer programs are written in some kind of Programming Language. A programmer writes in a language (such as :term:`Python`, :term:`NetLogo`, or :term:`Java`) very carefully, because computers must have precise instructions.

    Python
        A popular programming language for research, industry, and education, Python is meant to be easy to understand without sacrificing power. There is a huge user community for Python, which means that many tools and examples are available for it.
