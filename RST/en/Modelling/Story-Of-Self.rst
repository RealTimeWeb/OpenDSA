Introduction
------------

.. epigraph::

    Nothing so conclusively proves [one's] ability to lead others as what [one] does from day to day to lead [oneself].
    
    -- *Thomas J. Watson, founder of IBM (1874-1956)*

Computational thinking is a powerful tool. Much of its power derives from its positioning at the intersection of computer science and society. Whether used to make a company profitable, solve an agricultural problem, encourage communities to vote, improve the diversity of an organization's employees, conduct social science experiments, inform public policy, uncover fraud, or predict the course of an epidemic, computational thinking grants coders, programmers, data scientists, and computational analysts the capacity to change the lives of individuals, local and global communities, and society at large. As exciting as computational thinking is, its very power requires understanding of the responsibilities that come with the ability to use real-world digital data to influence, if not manipulate, how others think and live. It is important to remember that like all specialized knowledge, depending on how it is used, computational thinking can:

#. Produce both accurate and misleading interpretations of phenomena,
#. Generate both effective and ineffective interventions, and
#. Result in changes that promote or undermine people's best interests as they, themselves, define them. 

For example, during the subprime mortgage-lending boom of 2003-2006, mortgage brokers used big data to infer race and target predatory loans to minorities [#f1]_ . But big data is also used to identify victims of predatory lending and help them build a strong credit record through education and fair and transparent loans [#f2]_ . Learning computational thinking necessitates learning how to use one's computational skills in ethically sound ways. Best practice in computational analysis requires practitioners to remain deserving of society's trust by staying attuned to their primary obligation: the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public [#f3]_ .

Today, scholars in disparate fields assert that knowledge of oneself is required for the preservation of the moral self as well as for moral leadership and moral action [#f4]_ [#f5]_ [#f6]_ . Harvard professor of business ethics Joseph L. Badaracco, Jr. is one of many prominent scholars who reminds us that all individuals in a position to lead are vulnerable to misusing their power precisely because of the enormous variety of (sometimes conflicting) demands that they face. Yet when these individuals take the time to answer for themselves fundamental questions about *who* they really are and *what* they really care about, they are far better able to make morally sound decisions. According to Badaracco:

    Leaders are tested, again and again, throughout their careers, and the self-knowledge gained from these tests of character is the heart of leadership. In other words, the difference between success and failure is not skill, technique, credentials, networking, or even experience. It is clarity about who one is. This self-knowledge is often the critical factor enabling leaders to do their work, meet their responsibilities, and live rewarding and useful lives. [#f7]_
 
Whether or not computational thinking becomes a part of your career, the specialized knowledge you will receive from your undergraduate education at Virginia Tech will place you in a position to make small and big changes in the world. As a leader-in-the-making, you want to create a vision that helps you

#. apply this knowledge in morally sound ways, 
#. preserve your moral self, 
#. recognize actual or potential misuses of professional power in yourself or others, and 
#. take moral action to stop or prevent harm.

Knowledge of oneself is the cornerstone of this vision. 

How do we achieve that? 


Story of Self
-------------

A great starting point for sharpening our vision of who we are is by telling our story. Our story is simply a *narrative* that enables us to explore meanings, challenges, and lessons we have learned, and to connect the dots between our past, present, and future. It is not a statement of beliefs or a list of values, traits, achievements, or aspirations. It certainly does not look like a resume. A resume would never include a failure. A *Story of Self* very well might.  

This exercise is an adaptation of the work of Harvard University sociologist and senior lecturer in public policy Marshall Ganz [#f8]_ .  Addressing community organizers and movement leaders, Ganz explains that:

    Stories are how we learn to make choices. Stories are how we learn to access the moral and intellectual resources we need to engage with the uncertain, the unknown, and the unpredicted. Because stories speak the language of emotion, the language of the heart, they teach us not only how we "ought to" act, but can in fact inspire us with the "courage to" act. And because the sources of emotion on which they draw are in our values, our stories can help us translate our values into action.

    By telling our personal stories of challenges we have faced, choices we have made, and what we learned from the outcomes, we can become more mindful of our own moral resources and, at the same time, share our wisdom so as to inspire others. Because stories enable us to communicate our values not as abstract principles, but as lived experience, they have the power to move others.

    [...]
  
    You may think that your story doesn't matter, that people aren't interested, that you shouldn't be talking about yourself. But when you do public work, you have a responsibility to offer a public account of who you are, why you do what you do, and where you hope to lead. If you don't author your public story, others will, and they may not tell it in the way that you like. [#f9]_

Imagine your story as a public, but introspective, narrative about the "why's" of your education at Virginia Tech. This is an opportunity to think deeply about key experiences, challenges, aspirations, commitments, and priorities that gave rise to your desire to continue learning and called you to pursue the specific educational path you are traversing right now. Although you may not (yet!) see yourself as a "community organizer" or "movement leader" or anyone who is engaged in "public work" – to use Ganz's terms – the computational thinking skills you are about to acquire and your undergraduate training at large can very well set you on such a path. Imagine, for example, the paths of some individuals not unlike you:

* Online petition platform *Change.org* founder Ben Rattray, who studied political science and economics and later decided to devote his life to electronic collective action
* Online lending platform *Kiva.org* co-founder Jessica Jackley, who studied political science, philosophy, and business administration and later committed herself to the cause of financial inclusion and social justice through electronic grassroots giving
* Handmade and vintage item e-commerce platform *Etsy* founder Rob Kalin, who studied classics and, drawing from his earlier experience as a carpenter, is now empowering craftspeople to sell their creations without middlemen. 

Your *Story of Self* can help you carve your professional life in a way that both serves your ideals and fulfills you. It does this by connecting you to your history, your vision, and your dreams about how you want to use your knowledge and what professional footprint you want to make. Your *Story of Self* can serve as a well of values that you draw upon for inspiration and guidance, especially when at career crossroads or challenging moral binds. Increased self-awareness about who you are and what kind of professional you aspire to become will also send cues to others about your ethics, standards, and boundaries. Last, but certainly not least, as a public story, your *Story of Self* can help keep you transparent and accountable to the people whose lives you may affect.      

Your *Story of Self* will undoubtedly evolve throughout your career, as its relevance to actions you take now become clearer. That's exactly as it should be. A first rendering of it at this early stage in your professional journey gives you an opportunity to articulate your bearings and connect your values to past experience and present and future action.  

Guidelines
----------

An initial version of your Story of Self is due soon, and a revised version will be due near the end of the semester.

**In 1-2 pages minimum, 12-point-style, single-spaced, write about you.**

Remember that your task is to write a *story*, not statements about your beliefs or values. This should be a personal narrative that you could stand up and share with an audience. Take on the role of storyteller and create a telling that connects you to and engages your readers. If you focus on events and people that defined you, challenged you, changed you, or helped you realize your most deeply held values, your story will hold your readers' attention and, most likely, inspire them as well. Don't worry about having a conclusion or punch line. This is an opportunity to gain a sense of meaning that will help you to explain where you've been, where you are now, and where you might be going.

For some examples of stories of self, take a look at the following links (note: these are 2-5 minute stories, not entire life histories!):

* Moyers & Company: `The Personal is Political <http://billmoyers.com/content/the-personal-is-political/>`_
* Joy Cushman: `Example Story <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0wq5VVxAFk>`_

To begin preparing for your story, consider "big" questions like the ones below. Remember though: **you do not need to address them all (and certainly we don't want you to answer them one-by-one or with rote biographical facts, as if you were taking an exam!).** Use them simply to stimulate your thinking. Feel free to explore different questions as well. *Try to focus your narrative on actual memories and significant experiences that shaped you.*

This is your story. And, like all of us, you have a powerful story to tell. Give it life and make it meaningful and memorable. Enjoy!

Questions to Stimulate your Thinking
------------------------------------

* **Who are you?**

  * What people, events, values made you the person you are today?
  * What challenges taught you the most about yourself?
  * What is a big life lesson you've learned?
  * Who are your role models?

* **How would you describe your moral compass?**

  * What are the core values that guide your decisions about what is "right" and "wrong"? Who are the individuals, groups, principles, or ideas that you want to be in harmony with when making difficult decisions? 
  * What connects you to these individuals, groups, principles, or ideas?    

* **What brought you to Virginia Tech?**

  * What do you want to learn?
  * What is your major and why did you choose it?
  * What made you enroll in a computational thinking class?
  * What dreams, aspirations, goals, or visions came with your decision to attend Virginia Tech? 

* **What expertise do you want to acquire?**

  * To what ends do you want to use your expertise?
  * What kind of a professional do you want to become?

* **What are your strongest commitments?**

  * What impact do you want to have in the world?
  * How do you want others to see you?
  * What do you want others to know about you?

* **Where do you see yourself in your life's journey?**

  * What are your life goals? 
  * What role do you see your career having in realizing your vision?  
  * If the Virginia Tech Collegiate Times were to write an article about you, what would you like to see?
