Web Application
---------------

Web Applications are a special type of website.

Website
  A collection of pages and content (e.g., pictures, videos) that are linked together using URLs. They are meant for consuming information - whether its a funny youtube video of a `Corgi bellyflopping <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glii-kazad8>`_ or an article on `Hokie Football <http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/20140811aaa.html>`_ .
  
Web Application
  A website that helps the user accomplish a task. For instance, GMail lets you send emails to your friends, Doodle lets you organize meetings, and `Scholar <https://scholar.vt.edu/portal>`_ lets you submit assignments for class.
  
If you just want to make a website to show off your trip to Asia, you do not need to build a Web Application. Stick to solutions like `Google Sites <https://sites.google.com>`_ and `WordPress <http://wordpress.org/>`_ , and keep your life simple. 

However, if you're interested in building the new Facebook or a better Scholar, then you should look into building your first Web Application. However, developing web applications is hard. You need to understand more than just Python - you also need to understand "HTML", "JavaScript", and the way that Servers work.
